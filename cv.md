### Summary:
I was fond of programming from my young age but kept using my programming skills to help me with different tasks during my education and work. I always wanted to receive a good level of programming to make it my main field of activity instead of hobby or support tool. I've started learning WEB-programming at may 2019 and I enjoy my choice. I am motivated and focused on my goal to become Junior Web Developer and grow as a professional in this area.
