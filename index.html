          <h2>Summary:</h2>
          <p>
            I was fond of programming since my young age but only kept using my
            programming skills to help me with different tasks during my
            education and work. I always wanted to receive a good level of
            programming to make it my main field of activity instead of hobby or
            support tool. I’ve started learning WEB-programming at May 2019 and
            I enjoy my choice. I am motivated and focused on my goal to become
            Junior Web Developer and grow as a professional at this area.

          <p>
            My English level ranges from B1 to B2 for written English and from
            A2 to B1 for spoken one. I can read and write well enough, but had
            not enough verbal practice.
